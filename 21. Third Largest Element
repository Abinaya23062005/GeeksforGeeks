21. THIRD LARGEST ELEMENT:


Given an array, arr of positiGiven an array, arr of positive integers. Find the third largest element in it. Return -1 if the third largest element is not found.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The third largest element in the array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] is 3.
Input: arr[] = [10, 2]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are less than three elements in the array, so the third largest element cannot be determined.
Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5]
Output: 5
Explanation: In the array [5, 5, 5], the third largest element can be considered 5, as there are no other distinct elements.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

SOLUTION OF THE ABOBE PROBLEM:


#JAVA CODE:

class Solution {
    int thirdLargest(int arr[]) {
                if (arr == null || arr.length < 3) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Array must contain at least three elements.");
        }

        int first = Integer.MIN_VALUE, second = Integer.MIN_VALUE, third = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num > first) {
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = num;
            } else if (num > second) {
                third = second;
                second = num;
            } else if (num > third) {
                third = num;
            }
        }

        return third;
    }
}
