15. SQUARE ROOT

Given a positive integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.

Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number

Examples:

Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.
Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Since, 11 is not a perfect square, floor of square root of 11 is 3.
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
SOLUTION OF THE ABOVE PROBLEM:


#JAVA CODE:

class Solution {
    int floorSqrt(int n) {
     
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) return n; 

        int low = 1, high = n, ans = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; 

            if (mid == n / mid) { 
                return mid;
            } else if (mid < n / mid) { 
                ans = mid; 
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
