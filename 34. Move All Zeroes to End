34. Move All Zeroes to End

You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.




SOLUTION OF THE ABOVE PROBLEM:

#JAVA CODE:

class Solution {
    void pushZerosToEnd(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
       int j = -1;
       for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
           if(arr[i] == 0){
               j = i;
               break;
           }
       }
       if(j == -1) return;
       for(int i = j + 1; i < n; i++){
           if(arr[i] != 0){
               int temp = arr[i];
               arr[i] = arr[j];
               arr[j] = temp;
               j++;
           }
       }
       
    }
}
