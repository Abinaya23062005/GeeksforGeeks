17. Palindrome of a Number


You are given an integer n. Your task is to determine whether it is a palindrome.

A number is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward, like the string examples "MADAM" or "MOM".

Examples:

Input: n = 555
Output: true
Explanation: The number 555 reads the same backward as forward, so it is a palindrome.
Input: n = 123
Output: false
Explanation: The number 123 reads differently backward (321), so it is not a palindrome.
Input: n = 1221
Output: true

SOLUTION OF THE ABOVE PROGRAM:

#JAVA CODE:

class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int num) {

        int originalNum = num;  
        int reverse = 0; 
        while (num > 0) {
            int digit = num % 10;  
            reverse = reverse * 10 + digit;  
            num /= 10;  
        }

        return originalNum == reverse;  
    }

    
}
